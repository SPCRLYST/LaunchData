INTRODUCTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Commercial Space Transportation: 2011 Year in Review summarizes U.S. and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
international launch activities for calendar year 2011. This report also provides a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
review and analysis of the past five years of commercial launch activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There were 84 orbital launch events worldwide in 2011, including commercial, civil,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and military missions. Appendix I contains the details of these events. Appendix II,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
details the first six-month projection of worldwide orbital launches for 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(FAA/AST) licensed one commercial orbital launch in 2011, compared to four",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
licensed launches in 2010. The license was for the launch of Sea Launch AG’s Zenit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3SL rocket in September.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Appendix III provides definitions for the terminology of this report.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 84 worldwide orbital launch attempts in 2011, 18 (21 percent) were",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"commercial. This is a decrease in commercial launches from 2010, when there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were 23 commercial orbital launches worldwide out of a total of 74 launches (see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 1). Much of this decrease stems from the fact that none of the vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
manufactured by the United States had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Non-Commercial Launches,any commercial launches in 2011. Four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Commercial Launches,commercial launches planned for 2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,under NASA’s Commercial Resupply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,,Services (CRS) and Commercial Orbital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Transportation Services (COTS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,66,programs were delayed until 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Russia had 56 percent of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,international commercial launch market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,with 10 commercial launches in 2011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Figure 1. 2011 Total Worldwide Launch Activity Sea Launch AG had two commercial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,launches accounting for 11 percent of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the commercial launch market. The return-to-flight launch from the Pacific Ocean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was the only FAA/AST-licensed orbital launch this year. Sea Launch carried out its,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"second launch out of Baikonur, Kazakhstan as part of the Land Launch program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Europe attained a 22 percent market share, conducting four commercial Ariane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 launches. China had two commercial launches of its Long March 3B vehicle,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
attaining 11 percent of the international commercial market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 84 orbital launches attempted worldwide, 6 were failures, including 1 failed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
commercial launch. Four of the failures were Russian launches on three different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launch vehicles:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,A Rockot launch vehicle failed to place the GEO IK-2 No. II remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,satellite in low Earth orbit (LEO) on February 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,A Proton M launch vehicle failed to put the Express AM4 into geosynchronous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,orbit (GEO) on August 17 (this was the commercial launch failure in 2011).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,A Soyuz launch vehicle failed to carry the Progress M-12M supply capsule to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the International Space Station (ISS) on August 24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,A Soyuz 2 1B launch vehicle failed to launch the Meridian 5 communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,satellite to a Molniya orbit on December 23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States and China each experienced one launch failure in 2011. A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taurus XL vehicle failed to launch NASA’s Earth science satellite, Glory, and three",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"university satellites on March 4. On August 18, a Long March 2C failed to place",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
China’s Shijian 11-04 experimental satellite into sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two suborbital flights were conducted under FAA permits in 2011. Both were,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"conducted by Blue Origin, using the PM-2 vehicle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The demand for commercial NGSO launches, which peaked in the late 1990s, was",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low in the four years before 2007. The number of commercial NGSO launches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sharply increased in 2007 and 2008, and then increased again in 2010 after a slow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
year in 2009. These high levels are mostly driven by the launch of replacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"satellites for the existing constellations, such as ORBCOMM and Globalstar, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the launch of new constellations, such as SAR-Lupe and COSMO-SkyMed. In",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2011, 2 of the 3 commercial NGSO launches deployed 12 more second-generation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Globalstar satellites. See Figure 15 for commercial launches by orbit type for the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last five years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 16 shows the number of payloads providing commercial services launched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on commercial and non-commercial vehicles over the past five years. The number of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
commercial NGSO satellites launched per year fluctuates significantly year to year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is because several commercial NGSO satellites are often launched together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(multi-manifested) on the same launch vehicle. The launches of Globalstar (6 in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2010 and 12 in 2011), ORBCOMM (6 in 2008) and RapidEye constellation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
satellites (5 in 2008) explain why there are significantly more payloads launched in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE AND LAUNCH TRENDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The commercial space transportation market is driven largely by the demand for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launches of GEO telecommunications satellites and to a lesser (but growing) extent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by a variety of NGSO satellites. Historically, the majority of commercial launches",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have been to GEO. Usually, GEO launches deploy larger payloads and require",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"larger launch vehicles, thus generating more revenue than those to NGSO. More",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
commercial launches to NGSO have taken place in recent years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The supply of launch vehicle options continues to increase, despite only a marginal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
increase in demand for launches. Competition remains strong between United,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"States, European, multinational, and Russian providers, while new entrants are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"joining, re-joining, or advancing toward the commercial market. For example, the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Land Launch version of the Zenit, the Dnepr, the Soyuz (marketed and launched",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by Arianespace), and the Falcon 9 are all competing for commercial launches. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Japanese are marketing the H IIA commercially, and the Indians and Chinese,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"although limited by the U.S. export policies, are also targeting commercial launch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERNATIONALLY COMPETED LAUNCHES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The definitions of “commercial payload” and “commercial launch” are complex and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open to interpretation (see Appendix II for definitions of these terms). Figure 18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shows trends for each country whose launch providers compete in the international,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
marketplace. The chart reflects only launch service providers competing in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
international marketplace for open-bid launch service contracts. From 2007 to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APPENDIX III: DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMMERCIAL SUBORBITAL OR ORBITAL LAUNCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial suborbital or orbital launch has one or more of the following characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The launch is licensed by FAA/AST.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The primary payload’s launch contract was internationally competed (see definition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,of internationally competed below). A primary payload is generally defined as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,payload with the greatest mass on a launch vehicle for a given launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The launch is privately financed without government support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAUNCH FAILURE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The payload did not reach a usable orbit (an orbit where some portion of the mission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be salvaged) or was destroyed as the result of a launch vehicle malfunction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INTERNATIONALLY COMPETED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An internationally competed launch contract is one in which the launch opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was available in principle to any capable launch service provider. An internationally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
competed launch is considered commercial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMMERCIAL PAYLOAD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial payload is described as having one or both of the following,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The payload is operated by a private company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"The payload is funded by the government, but provides satellite service partially",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,or totally through a private or semi-private company. This distinction is usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,applied to certain telecommunication satellites whose transponders are partially or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"totally leased to a variety of organizations, some or all of which generate revenues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Examples are Russia’s Express and Ekran series of spacecraft. All other payloads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"are classified as noncommercial (government civil, government military, or non-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,profit).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ORBITS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Geosynchronous Earth orbit (GSO): A spacecraft in GSO is synchronized with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"the Earth’s rotation, orbiting once every 24 hours, and appears to an observer on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the ground to be stationary in the sky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO): GEO is a broad category used for any circular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"orbit at an altitude of 35,852 kilometers (22,277 miles) with a low inclination",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,(over the equator).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
• 30 •,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2011 Year in Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Non-geosynchronous orbit (NGSO): NGSO satellites are those in orbits other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"than GEO, including:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"Low Earth orbit (LEO): lowest achievable orbit, about 2,400 kilometers,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"Medium Earth orbit (MEO): 2,400 kilometers to GEO,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,"Elliptical (ELI): a highly elliptical orbit,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,External (EXT): used for trajectories beyond GEO (such as interplanetary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"trajectories), and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,•,Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO): an orbit that passes over the same part of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Earth at roughly the same time each day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PAYLOAD USE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Classified: Any system whose purpose is officially deemed classified or cannot be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,officially verified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Communications: Any system designed to receive and transmit data for purposes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"of facilitating communications. This includes fixed satellite services, mobile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"satellite services, military communications, store-and-forward systems, asset",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"tracking, and similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"Crewed: Any system designed primarily to transport humans into, through, or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
