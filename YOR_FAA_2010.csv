INTRODUCTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Commercial Space Transportation: 2010 Year in Review summarizes U.S. and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"international launch activities for calendar year 2010, and provides a historical look",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the past five years of commercial launch activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All 74 worldwide orbital launches in 2010, including commercial, civil, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"military missions, are shown in Appendix I at the end of this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(FAA/AST) licensed four commercial orbital launches in 2010, compared to the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
five licensed launches in 2009. All four of the orbital licensed launches used U.S.-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
built vehicles. Two launches were on Delta vehicles (a Delta IV and a Delta II),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"operated by Boeing Launch Services (BLS), and two launches were on the Falcon 9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocket by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, 23 commercial orbital launches occurred worldwide in 2010, representing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"31 percent of the 74 total launches for the year. This marked a decrease from 2009,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which saw 24 commercial orbital launches worldwide, out of a total of 78 launches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Russia conducted 13 commercial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-Commercial Launches,"launch campaigns in 2010, bringing its",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commercial Launches,international commercial launch market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,share to 57 percent for the year. This,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"was an increase from 2009, driven by",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,an additional Soyuz and Proton launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,and two more Dnepr launches. There,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,were four FAA/AST-licensed orbital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"launches, accounting for 17 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,of the worldwide commercial launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,market in 2010. Europe attained a 26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

commercial Ariane 5 launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 74 worldwide orbital launches, there were four launch failures, all of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which were non-commercial launches. The first failure of the year was by an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indian GSLV Mark 2 launch vehicle, while attempting to launch the GSAT 4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
telecommunications and navigation satellite to geosynchronous orbit (GEO) on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
April 14. The Korean KSLV 1 failed to launch a Korean low Earth orbit (LEO),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"atmospheric research satellite, STSAT 2B, on June 8. The third launch failure was",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a Proton M launch vehicle carrying three Russian Glonass navigation satellites on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"December 5. Finally, a second attempt by India to launch its GSLV rocket carrying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insat 4D GEO communications satellite also resulted in a failure on December 25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No suborbital flights were conducted under FAA experimental permits in 2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. AND FAA-LICENSED ORBITAL LAUNCH ACTIVITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAA-Licensed Orbital Launch Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were four FAA-licensed launches in 2010: one GEO and three LEO.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the past five years, FAA has typically licensed four or five launches per year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, in 2008, FAA licensed 11 launches, including five Sea Launch Zenit 3SL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launches of commercial GEO communications satellites. The Sea Launch company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conducted one launch in 2009 and none in 2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All four of the licensed launches in 2010 took place from U.S. ranges. Although,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"historically most FAA-licensed launches have been to GEO, in 2010 three of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"four launches were to LEO, and only one to GEO. The LEO launches included",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the launch of SpaceX Dragon capsule qualification unit in June and the December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launch of the first Dragon demonstration unit, both on Falcon 9 vehicles. These",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launches were part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COTS program. The remaining LEO launch was of a Delta II launch vehicle which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
carried an Italian dual-use COSMO-SkyMed satellite from Vandenberg Air Force,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Base (VAFB) in California. The GEO licensed launch was for a Delta IV vehicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FAA Suborbital Flight Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2010, there were no suborbital flights conducted under the authority of FAA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
experimental permits or licenses. Although there were no experimental permits in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2009, there were five in 2008 and nine in 2007. The primary reason for the drop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in experimental-permitted flights was a change in FAA regulations in 2009 that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"allowed companies to fly their vehicles under amateur rocket regulations, rather",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
than requiring experimental permits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unlike FAA-licensed flights, permitted flights are limited to reusable suborbital",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launch vehicles and intended for technology development, particular testing for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"crew, or testing prior to obtaining a license. Vehicles cannot carry property or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Figure 15 shows the number of payloads providing commercial services launched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on commercial and non-commercial vehicles over the past five years. The number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of commercial NGSO satellites launched per year fluctuates significantly year to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
year. Frequently several of this type of satellite is launched on a single vehicle giving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rise to a fluctuation in the number of total payloads launched per year. The launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of Globalstar (six in 2010), ORBCOMM (six in 2008) and RapidEye constellation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(five in 2008) satellites explain why there are significantly more payloads launched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE AND LAUNCH TRENDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The commercial space transportation market is driven largely by the demand for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launches of GEO telecommunications satellites, and to a lesser (but growing)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"extent, a variety of NGSO satellites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since 2006, about 65 percent of commercial launches have been to GEO, which",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generates more revenue than the NGSO market and generally deploys larger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
payloads. The GEO launch rate has increased slightly in the last few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, this share of GEO payloads is decreasing and more NGSO payloads have",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been launched recently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The supply of launch vehicle options continues to increase, despite only a marginal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"increase in demand for launches. Competition remains strong between U.S.,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"European, multinational, and Russian providers, while new entrants are joining,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"re-joining, or advancing toward the commercial market. For example, the Land",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Launch version of the Zenit, the Dnepr, the Soyuz (launched and marketed by",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arianespace), and the Falcon 9 are all competing for commercial launches. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Japanese are marketing the H-IIA commercially, while the Indians and Chinese,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"although limited by the U.S. export policies, are also targeting commercial launch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APPENDIX II: DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMMERCIAL SUBORBITAL OR ORBITAL LAUNCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial suborbital or orbital launch has one or more of the following characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The launch is licensed by FAA/AST.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The primary payload’s launch contract was internationally competed (see definition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,of internationally competed below). A primary payload is generally defined as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,payload with the greatest mass on a launch vehicle for a given launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The launch is privately financed without government support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAUNCH FAILURE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The payload did not reach a usable orbit (an orbit where some portion of the mission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be salvaged) or was destroyed as the result of a launch vehicle malfunction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INTERNATIONALLY COMPETED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An internationally competed launch contract is one in which the launch opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was available in principle to any capable launch service provider. Such a launch is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considered commercial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMMERCIAL PAYLOAD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial payload is described as having one or both of the following,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The payload is operated by a private company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"The payload is funded by the government, but provides satellite service partially",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,or totally through a private or semi-private company. This distinction is usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,applied to certain telecommunication satellites whose transponders are partially or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"totally leased to a variety of organizations, some or all of which generate revenues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Examples are Russia’s Express and Ekran series of spacecraft. All other payloads are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"classified as noncommercial (government civil, government military, or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,non-profit).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ORBITS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,A spacecraft in geostationary Earth orbit (GSO) is synchronized with the Earth’s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"rotation, orbiting once every 24 hours, and appears to an observer on the ground",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,to be stationary in the sky. GEO is a broader category used for any circular orbit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"at an altitude of 35,852 kilometers (22,277 miles) with a low inclination (i.e., over",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the equator).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2010 Year in Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Non-geosynchronous orbit (NGSO) satellites are those in orbits other than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"GEO. They are located in low Earth orbit (LEO, lowest achievable orbit to about",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2,400 kilometers, or 1,491 miles), medium Earth orbit (MEO, 2,400 kilometers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"to GEO), and all other high or elliptical orbits or trajectories. ELI (“elliptical) is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,used to describe a highly elliptical orbit (such as those used for Russian Molniya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"satellites), and EXT (“external”) is a designation used for trajectories beyond GEO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,(such as interplanetary trajectories).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
