EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Commercial Space Transportation: 2014 Year in Review summarizes U.S. and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"international orbital launch activities for calendar year 2014, including launches",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation (FAA AST).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2014, the United States, Russia, Europe, China, Japan, India, Israel, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"multinational provider Sea Launch conducted a total of 92 orbital launches, 23 of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which were commercial (See Figure 1). In 2013 there were 81 launches, including",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23 commercial launches. Three of the 92 launches failed; two government,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launches, Russia’s Proton M launch of the Express AM4R communications satellite",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and Europe’s Soyuz 2.1b launch of two Galileo navigation satellites, and one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"commercial launch, United States’ Antares 120 launch of the Cygnus commercial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cargo capsule to the International Space Station (ISS).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highlights of 2014 in the orbital space launch industry:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"The United States performed 11 commercial orbital launches, making 2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the most active year since the late 1990s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"NASA continued its ISS Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program, with",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the launch of five resupply missions. One CRS mission of a Cygnus cargo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,spacecraft launched by an Antares vehicle resulted in a launch failure;,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"SpaceX continued to successfully launch payloads for commercial clients,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,including three commercial launches to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO),,,,,,,,,,,,,
,and one to low earth orbit (LEO);,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,The U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) exceeded its own,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"record number of 11 launches last year with 14 missions, launching 9 Atlas V,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"4 Delta IV, and one Delta II;",,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"One of these ULA vehicles, a Delta IV Heavy, successfully launched NASA’s",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle on Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT 1). The launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,was licensed by FAA AST;,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Two new orbital launch vehicles were successfully tested. The Russian Angara,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,launch vehicle family was introduced by a suborbital test of Angara 1.1PP in,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,July and a GEO insertion of a dummy payload by Angara A5 in December.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,India successfully performed a suborbital test of its LVM3 launch vehicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,(formerly known as GSLV Mk 3); and,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Orbital launch vehicles deployed 46 CubeSat class satellites launched as,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,piggyback payloads. Sixty seven more CubeSats were delivered to the ISS,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"by the Cygnus, Dragon, and Progress spacecraft and then released into orbit",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,from the ISS. Twenty nine more CubeSats were lost during a failed launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,attempt of a Cygnus cargo spacecraft to the ISS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Revenues from the 23 commercial orbital launches in 2014 were estimated to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be about $2.36 billion. These revenues are nearly a half billion dollars higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"than in 2013 while consistent with commercial launch revenue in 2009, 2010, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2012. The estimated commercial orbital launch revenues of $1.1 billion for U.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
providers was the highest in five years (See Figure 2). This is the highest since,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1998, when the total was $1.12 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAA AST licensed 12 commercial orbital,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launches in 2014, compared to seven licensed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launches in 2013. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 vehicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had six licensed launches: two in April and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worldwide Launch Revenues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Estimated revenues from the 23 commercial launch events in 2014 amounted to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
approximately $2.36 billion (Figure 4). These revenues are nearly a half billion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dollars higher than in 2013 while consistent with commercial launch revenue in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2009, 2010, and 2012. The following are 2014 revenues by country:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"Commercial launch revenues in the United States amounted to $1.1 billion,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the highest since 1998. Estimated commercial launch revenue for 2013 was,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,$339.5 million.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"Russian commercial launch revenues were approximately $218 million, 30",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,percent of the last year’s $759 million. The delay caused by a civil government,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Proton failure in May resulted in only two commercial Proton launches in 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The other two Russian commercial launches this year were performed by the,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,low cost Dnepr vehicle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"European commercial launch revenues were approximately $920 million, a 30",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,percent increase from 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,"China did not perform any commercial launches in 2014, same as in 2013. It",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,earned an estimated total of $90 million for two commercial launches in 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
•,Multinational (Sea Launch) revenues from the single 2014 launch were,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"estimated at $95 million, on par with the 2013 results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Payments for launch services are typically spread over one to two years before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the launch, but for the purposes of this report, revenue is counted in the year a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer’s payload launches. Launch revenues are attributed to the country or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
region where the primary vehicle manufacturer is based. These revenues are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assessed based on commercial launch price estimates for each launch vehicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FAA-Licensed Orbital Launch Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were 12 FAA-licensed orbital launches in 2014 (see Table 3) from four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different launch sites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SpaceX’s Falcon 9 vehicle made six licensed launches: two CRS missions to the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISS and four launches for commercial communications satellite operators, all from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Orbital’s Antares had three FAA-licensed launch attempts, two successful CRS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"missions to the ISS and one failed CRS launch attempt, from the Mid-Atlantic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regional Spaceport (MARS) in Virginia. ULA performed two FAA-licensed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"launches, one by Atlas V of the WorldView 3 commercial remote sensing satellite",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) and the other by Delta IV Heavy of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea Launch’s Zenit 3SL vehicle performed one FAA-licensed launch of a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
commercial telecommunications satellite Eutelsat 3B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the past five years (in 2010–2014), FAA has on average licensed about",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"six launches per year. However, in 2014 the number of FAA-licensed launches",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exceeded the 11 launches FAA licensed in 2008. At that time, five of the 11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAA-licensed launches were Sea Launch’s Zenit 3SL carrying commercial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GEO communications satellites. With the Zenit 3SL launches effectively put on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hold after this year’s single launch, the increase in licensed orbital launches is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
predominantly driven by U.S. launch organizations. SpaceX and Orbital (teamed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commercial Space Transportation 2014 Year in Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEFINITIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commercial Suborbital or Orbital Launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial suborbital or orbital launch has one or more of these characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
••,The launch is licensed by FAA AST.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
••,The primary payload’s launch contract was internationally competed (see,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,definition of internationally competed below). A primary payload is generally,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,defined as the payload with the greatest mass on a launch vehicle for a given,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
••,The launch is privately financed without government support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Launch Failure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A launch failure happens when the payload does not reach a usable orbit (an,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
orbit where some portion of the mission can be salvaged) or is destroyed as the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
result of a launch vehicle malfunction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Internationally Competed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An internationally competed launch contract is one in which the launch opportunity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was available in principle to any capable launch service provider. Such a launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is considered commercial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Commercial Payload,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A commercial payload has one or both of these characteristics:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
••,The payload is operated by a private company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
••,"The payload is funded by the government, but provides satellite service",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,partially or totally through a private or semi-private company. This distinction is,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,usually applied to certain telecommunications satellites whose transponders,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"are partially or totally leased to a variety of organizations, some or all of which",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,generate revenues. Examples include Russia’s Express and Ekran series of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,spacecraft.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All other payloads are classified as non-commercial (government civil, government",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"military, or non-profit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Orbits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A spacecraft in geostationary Earth orbit (GSO) is synchronized with the Earth’s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rotation, orbiting once every 24 hours, and appears to an observer on the ground",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be stationary in the sky. Geosynchronous (GEO) is a broader category used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for any circular orbit at an altitude of 35,852 kilometers (22,277 miles) with a low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"inclination (i.e., near or on the equator).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Non-geosynchronous orbit (NGSO) satellites are those in orbits other than GEO.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
• 23 •,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are located in low Earth orbit (LEO, lowest achievable orbit to about 2,400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kilometers, or 1,491 miles), medium Earth orbit (MEO, 2,400 kilometers to GEO),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SSO (Sun Synchronous Orbit), and all other orbits or trajectories. ELI (“elliptical”)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
describes a highly elliptical orbit (such as those used for Russian Molniya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"satellites), and EXT (“external”) describes trajectories beyond GEO (such as",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interplanetary trajectories).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ve h i c l e M a s s C l a s s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Small launch vehicles are defined as those with a payload capacity of less than,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2,268 kilograms (5,000 pounds) at 185 kilometers (100 nautical miles) altitude",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a 28.5-degree inclination. Medium to heavy launch vehicles are capable of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"carrying more than 2,269 kilograms at 185 kilometers altitude and a 28.5-degree",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inclination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
